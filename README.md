# Our base Webpack config

## What's in the Box?

- Babel with `@babel/preset-env` and `@babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import`
- Postcss with `postcss-easy-import`, `tailwindcss` and `postcss-preset-env`
- `.vue` file support, also aliases the `vue` dependency to the full build
- Creates a `mix-manifest.json` file
- Sends system notifications on build
- Disables most of Webpack's stats
